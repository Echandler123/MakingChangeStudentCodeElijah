I made a method that will be recursive called findways but I have not figure out what all the bases cases would be and how to finish the method. |
| Feb 9   |  7:00 - 7:30  | Finished my memoization approach the only error I ran into were index out of bound errors so I just added an if statement to one of my base cases. I was also having a small problem with the test largest though. That was because when looking at the slides it says to use a 2d array of ints. Originally I just had longs because that was what the function is returning but I swapped to from a 2d array of longs to int then just casted the number of ways as an int which is what was causing the problem.  I found out by just trying to go back to the using an array of longs though I do not know if there is a way to solve the problem using ints instead of longs as that would probably be more space efficient. |
