| Jan 28  | 10:50 - 11:50 | The solution I was thinking about was using an adjacency list to make a list to keep track of each possible combination similar to the way we kept track of each path in heatingup. I made a method that will be recursive called findways but I have not figure out what all the bases cases would be and how to finish the method. |
